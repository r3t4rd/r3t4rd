  <samp>Ayo. I'm <a href="https://github.com/r3t4rd">r3t4rd</a>.
  <br>
  I'm Source Engine level-artist from Russia. Started out in high school with voluntary work as part of the LampServ team, testing my web-design [#html, #css, #javascript, #php] and #lua as a whole.<br>
  Was part of Team Anigun and had a lil work experience with AnimeLife. <br><br>
  Nowadays, I take <strong>comissions</strong> for gaming communities and trying to create something more than just yet another one typical DarkRP gameplay in Garry's mod.<br><br>

  You can also find me @vk, @discord and @wooh.pw
