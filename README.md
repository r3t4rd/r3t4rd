  I'm Source Engine level-artist from Russia. Started out in high school with voluntary work as part of the <a href="https://vk.com/lampserv">LampServ</a> team, testing my web-design [#html, #css, #javascript, #php] and #lua as a whole.<br>
  Was part of <a href="https://vk.com/clubanigun">Team Anigun</a> and had a lil work experience with <a href="https://vk.com/an1melife">AnimeLife</a>. <br><br>
  Nowadays, I take <strong>comissions</strong> for gaming communities and trying to create something more than just yet another one typical DarkRP gameplay in Garry's mod.<br><br>
